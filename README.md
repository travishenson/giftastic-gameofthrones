# GIFtastic Game of Thrones

The initial page displays preset buttons that, when clicked, will display 10 GIFs related to the button's label/topic that will be pulled from the GIPHY database using the GIPHY API. The GIFs pulled will initially be static/non-moving, but the state of the GIFs will change if a user clicks on them. (A still GIF will animate when clicked, and an animated GIF will become static when clicked)

Under every GIF, the rating of the GIF (pulled from the GIPHY API) will be displayed.

There is also a form that will take a user's input and add the input as a button to the list of buttons. For example, if a user types in "Arya Stark" and clicks "Add Button", a button will appear with that label. When the user clicks the button, GIFs related to Arya Stark will be populated on the page in the same way the other buttons work.
